In this  I created new Rupee, Dollar & Euro class in which there will be an Inner class which will have methods for conversion to other currencies. For example: Rupee will have an inner class with methods which converts Amount to Dollar & Euro.

·         Made another inner class inside the above method which stores the rates for currency conversion. 

·         Made another static inner class which has an addAmount static method. This method adds all the amount passed for Rupee/Dollar/Euro.
